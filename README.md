# Node-WebPack-React-Boilerplate
Minimal app with Node Webpack React for starting up, with linting and has commands for development and production env.

Nothing here is my doing apart from aggregation of information from many sources. Take a dig at it, I have kept it minimal so that its easy to understand. But I think this thing is not for starters. If you have any problems understanding the code or find any issues please contact me @ [akabhirav@gmail.com](mailto:akabhirav@gmail.com)
